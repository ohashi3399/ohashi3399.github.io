## Brief Introduction

As a University student, I dedicated to research the topic of **physiological signal such as extraction of pulse wave from facial video**, and the estimation of stress levels arise from the changes of autonomic nerves activity estimated from facial video. Through 3 years, I got basic experiences based on optical-based (i.e. layered skin model) image decomposition, and temporal-frequency domain signal extraction for acquiring autonomic nerves activity.

As I started to work at first company, I dedicated to research the topics of **image processing (OCR, Optical Character Recognition) and natural language processing (GEC, Grammatical Error Correction)**. Through 2 years, I got fundamental experiences of machine learning-based research work such as research survey, model design and implementation, training strategy, memory saving coding, error analysis, technical reports, suggestion of new research topic, and patents.

At current company, I am dedicating works based on above basic experiences and furthere somewhat challenging tasks. My interests
are shown as below:

## Interests

- Autonomous driving
- human-machine interaction when driving
- Experimental design when driving
- Evaluation metrics design towards real world applications
- Real time multi modal system

## Contents

I plan to list below what I done.
